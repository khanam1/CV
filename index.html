  <p><strong>Human Resources Professional</strong></p>
  <em>
    <p>I am pleased to bring to your notice that my educational qualifications which includes a <strong>International Business degree in Human Resources domain from England</strong> and Bachelors degree in Engineering gives me the capabilities to
      address both technical
      and business challenges that a Talent acquisition Consultant job inherits.</p>
    <p>I have been successful in achieving my educational credentials by constantly pursuing and demonstrating flexibility to adapt to ever changing priorities.</p>
    <p>I have had the tremendous opportunity of working in different geographies of the world which has taught me a sense of understanding of people that come from different geographical and cultural backgrounds which has strengthened my non-partisan
      hiring etiquette.
      My employment experience brings to the table the ability to cater to different operating needs of the full recruitment cycle right from sourcing the suitable candidates through Job portals, social networking etc. It also makes me a productive
      utilizer of available candidate pools with constant innovation of active mining of top workforce talent thereby fulfilling the expectations of all the stakeholders of the <strong>Talent Acquisition lifecycle.</strong></p>
    <p>I thank you in advance for considering my profile.</p>
    <p>Amjad Khan.</p>
